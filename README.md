Multiple Linear Regression

The goal of this project is to build regression model(s) to determine which marketing promotion budget has the highest impact on company sales: TV, Radio, Social Media. This project has three separate Jupyter Notebooks building off the further exploration of the previous analysis. Simple Linear Regression model identified TV has the marketing promotion budget that provides the greatest increase in sales. Refer to Simple Linear Regression.ipynb using marketing_and_sales_data_evaluate_lr.csv file. According to the linear regression model, an increase of one million dollars for the TV promotional budget will result in an estimated 3.5614 million dollars more in sales. Multiple Linear Regression was used to estimate sales given different TV promotional budgets. Refer to Multiple Linear Regression.ipynb using the marketing_sales_data.csv file. The multiple linear regression model shows a high TV promotion budget will yield the highest increase in sales.
